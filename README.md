# Bayes Classifier
This repositoy contains the implementation of a Bayes Classifier, written from scratch. </br>
Show how computational programming task (such as ml algorithms) can be implemented with an understandable,
documented and user-friendly structure, ending up with a sort of API that's easy to maintain, and easy to 
use.

## Distribution package:
#### Single-variate distributions:
 - Singlevariate Normal Distribution
 - Poisson Distribution
 - Gamma Distribution

#### Multi-variate distributions:
 - Multivariate Normal Distribution

### Creating a new distribution class:
Create a new class which inherits the Distribution base class



## Running programs:
### Running Example Programs:
    $ python example_1.py
